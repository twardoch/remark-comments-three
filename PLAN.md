1.  **Create Project Management Files:**
    *   Create `PLAN.md` with an initial plan (this plan).
    *   Create `TODO.md` to track pending tasks.
    *   Create `CHANGELOG.md` to document changes.
2.  **Analyze `package.json`:**
    *   Review dependencies for outdated or unnecessary packages.
    *   Check scripts for correctness and efficiency.
    *   Ensure metadata (author, repository, license, etc.) is accurate.
3.  **Examine Build Process (`build.sh` and `package.json` scripts):**
    *   Understand the current build process.
    *   Identify potential improvements for speed and reliability.
    *   Ensure the build output in `dist/` is correct.
4.  **Review Code (`src/index.js`):**
    *   Understand the plugin's functionality (remark plugin for comments).
    *   Look for areas to improve code clarity, efficiency, or maintainability.
    *   Check for adherence to ESLint rules defined in `.eslintrc.json`.
5.  **Review Tests (`__tests__/index.js`):**
    *   Ensure tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases.
    *   Verify that tests pass with the current code.
    *   Update tests if code changes are made.
6.  **Update Documentation (`README.md`):**
    *   Ensure `README.md` is clear, accurate, and up-to-date with any changes made.
    *   Verify links and badges.
    *   Update installation and usage instructions if necessary.
7.  **Run Linters and Tests:**
    *   Run `npm run pretest` (which runs ESLint).
    *   Run `npm test` (which runs Jest).
    *   Fix any issues identified.
8.  **Update `TODO.md` and `PLAN.md`:**
    *   Reflect completed tasks and any new findings or adjustments to the plan.
9.  **Submit Changes:**
    *   Commit all changes with a descriptive message.
